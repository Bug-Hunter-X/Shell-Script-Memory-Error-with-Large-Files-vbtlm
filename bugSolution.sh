#This script reads the file in chunks, limiting the amount of data held in memory. 
#The -d '' option tells read to use the null character as a delimiter. 
#This avoids problems if lines in the file contain embedded newlines.  
#xargs -0 and find -print0  are used to avoid issues with filenames containing whitespace or special characters.
