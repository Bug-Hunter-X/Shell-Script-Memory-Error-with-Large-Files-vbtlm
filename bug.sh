# This script attempts to process a large file line by line,
# but it can encounter issues if the file is significantly larger
# than available memory.

while IFS= read -r line; do
  # Process each line...
  echo "Processing: $line"
done < "large_file.txt"

#The problem is that this script will read the entire file into memory.  If the file is too large, this will cause a memory error.
#The solution is to process the file in chunks.
